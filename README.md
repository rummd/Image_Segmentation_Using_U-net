# Image_Segmentation_Using_U-net
This repository contains the code for an image segmentation project, that was part Deep Learning Speacialization assignment. Image segmentation is the process of dividing an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which corresponds to a different object or part of the image.
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately segment objects in images.
Model: The model used for this project is a U-Net architecture.
